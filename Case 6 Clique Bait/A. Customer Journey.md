## Solution - B. Product Funnel Analysis

### 1. Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:

- How many times was each product viewed?
- How many times was each product added to cart?
- How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
- How many times was each product purchased?
- Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.


## Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:

- Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?
- Which product was most likely to be abandoned?
- Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?
- What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?
- What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?
