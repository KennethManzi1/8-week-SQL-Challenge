````sql
--Customer A total Amount
SELECT SUM(mn.price) AS total_sales
FROM dbo.sales AS sl
LEFT JOIN dbo.menu AS mn ON sl.product_id = mn.product_id
WHERE sl.customer_id = 'A'
--GROUP BY sl.customer_id, mn.product_name, mn.price, sl.order_date, mn.product_id
--ORDER BY sl.customer_id, mn.product_id

--Customer B total Amount
SELECT SUM(mn.price) AS total_sales
FROM dbo.sales AS sl
LEFT JOIN dbo.menu AS mn ON sl.product_id = mn.product_id
WHERE sl.customer_id = 'B'
--GROUP BY sl.customer_id, mn.product_name, mn.price, sl.order_date, mn.product_id
--ORDER BY sl.customer_id, mn.product_id

--Customer C total Amount
SELECT SUM(mn.price) AS total_sales
FROM dbo.sales AS sl
LEFT JOIN dbo.menu AS mn ON sl.product_id = mn.product_id
WHERE sl.customer_id = 'C'

### Rank All The Things - Danny also requires further information about the ```ranking``` of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ```ranking``` values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.

````sql

SELECT R.* , CASE WHEN R.member = 'Y' THEN RANK() OVER(Partition BY R.customer_id, R.member ORDER BY R.order_date) 
WHEN R.Member = 'N' THEN NULL
END AS ranking

SELECT sl.customer_id, mn.product_name, mn.price, sl.order_date, mb.join_date, 
CASE WHEN sl.order_date >= mb.join_date THEN 'Y'
WHEN sl.order_date < mb.join_date THEN 'N'
WHEN mb.join_date IS NULL THEN 'N'
END AS member
FROM dbo.sales AS sl
LEFT JOIN dbo.menu AS mn ON sl.product_id = mn.product_id
LEFT JOIN dbo.members mb ON sl.customer_id = mb.customer_id
--WHERE sl.customer_id = 'A'
--WHERE order_date < join_date
