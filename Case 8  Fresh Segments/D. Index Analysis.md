# Case Study #8 - Fresh Segments

## Solution - D. Index Analysis


### The index_value is a measure which can be used to reverse calculate the average composition for Fresh Segmentsâ€™ clients. Average composition can be calculated by dividing the composition column by the index_value column rounded to 2 decimal places.

We will use the interestmetrics CTE and interestmaps CTE to solve all the problems in D.

WITH interestmetrics AS
(
    SELECT *
