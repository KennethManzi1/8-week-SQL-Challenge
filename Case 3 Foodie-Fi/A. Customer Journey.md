# Case Study #3 - Foodie-Fi

## Solution - A. Customer Journey

### 1. Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

````sql
---A Customer Journey Query

SELECT subs.customer_id, pn.plan_id, pn.plan_name, subs.start_date, LAG(subs.start_date) OVER(ORDER BY customer_id) AS [Previous Start Date],
DATEDIFF(day, LAG(subs.start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY subs.start_date),subs.start_date ) AS [Difference between Current Date and Previous Date]
FROM dbo.subscriptions AS subs 
FULL JOIN dbo.plans AS pn ON subs.plan_id = pn.plan_id
WHERE subs.customer_id < 11
